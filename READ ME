Project - OS Kernel Simulator
The OS Kernel Simulator is a project that simulates core functionalities of an operating system's kernel.
It manages process scheduling, memory management, and system calls, allowing users to interact with a 
simplified kernel environment.
Project Goals:
Simulate process creation, scheduling, and termination.
Implement CPU scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, Round Robin).
Handle memory allocation and paging.
Provide a command-line and web-based interface for user interaction.
